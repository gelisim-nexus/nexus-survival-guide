## Scholarships, Discounts, and Their "Invisible" Rules

Beyond the standard tuition fees, there are critical articles in the regulations that require strategic maneuvers. Here is an analysis of the financial support system:

### 1. Types of Scholarships and Discounts
Istanbul Gelişim University offers a variety of financial aids to support academic success and optimize education costs:

* **Rank Scholarships:** For students who rank within specific success tiers (from top 10 to 1000) in national exams, a monthly stipend is provided for 9 months per year throughout the normal duration of study.
* **High School First Place Scholarship:** Students who graduated as valedictorians and are placed in 100% scholarship slots of specific faculties (within their top 5 preferences) receive an additional monthly stipend for 9 months.
* **Institutional Discount:** A 5-10% discount for students coming from educational institutions that have a protocol/agreement with Istanbul Gelişim University.
* **Sibling Discount:** A 5% discount applied to the tuition fees of each sibling when more than one sibling is enrolled at IGU simultaneously.
* **Come to Gelişim Discount:** A special university admission program where candidates with unique talents, projects, or ideas apply with a motivation letter for specific scholarship opportunities.
* **Academic Success Scholarship:** A 5% incentive discount or support scholarship for the following academic year for students who achieve a CGPA (GANO) of 3.50/4.00 or higher.
* **Graduate Education Discount:** Up to 100% discount for Master's and PhD programs based on success rankings or specific academic criteria like CGPA and language scores.
* **Transfer (Yatay Geçiş) Scholarship:** Discounts provided to students transferring from other universities or internal transfers (applied as 75% for those moving from a 100% scholarship slot to a new department).
* **R&D Incentive Scholarship:** A scholarship granted by the Board of Trustees to students who realize innovative and entrepreneurial projects on a global scale.
* **Meal Scholarship:** Nutritional support provided to a set number of students determined annually by the Board of Trustees.

### 2. Extra Supports (The Unknowns)

* **Foreign Language Invoice Support:** For students in Turkish programs scoring 70+ on YDS/YÖKDİL (or 80+ for English programs), the university may cover language course expenses at a rate determined by the Board upon presentation of an invoice.
* **Office Furniture Support:** IGU graduates who open their own business can receive office furniture support upon submitting official business registration documents.
* **R&D Incentive:** Direct R&D scholarships can be defined for students developing world-class innovative projects.

### 3. Combining Scholarships
Under normal conditions, if you qualify for multiple discounts, only the highest one applies. However, there are two major exceptions:
* **Sibling Discount:** This can be combined with other discounts.
* **Cash Scholarships:** Monthly stipends can be received alongside tuition fee discounts.
* **Note:** Some discounts and Institutional Discounts cannot be combined.

### 4. Internal Transfer Logic (75% Rule)
If you are studying with a 100% (Full) scholarship and decide to make an **internal transfer (kurum içi yatay geçiş)**, your scholarship is automatically adjusted to **75%** in the new department. However, for partial scholarship students, the existing rate continues as is.

### 5. Academic Success Scholarship & The 3.50 Threshold
If your year-end CGPA is 3.50 or higher, you can receive an extra 5% discount. However:
* You must have successfully passed all courses in your curriculum.
* Students with transferred credits (intibak) or those in Double Major (ÇAP) programs are not eligible.
* Summer school grades are not included in this CGPA calculation.

## Strategies to Earn and Protect Scholarships

### Strategic Steps for New Applicants
* **Come to Gelişim:** Regardless of exam scores, if you have a project or a unique talent, you can apply with a motivation letter. **Note: This cannot be combined with any other scholarship. If accepted, you waive other discount rights**.

### Post-Graduate Scholarships
* **PhD:** 100% discount (free education) is provided to T.C. citizens enrolled via domestic quotas.
* **Master's:** 100% scholarship quotas are opened every term for candidates with a Bachelor's CGPA of 3.00+ and ALES/Language scores of 75+.
