# Gelisim Nexus Wiki: Grade Improvement Strategies and Regulatory Analysis

This page includes the legal rights and strategic calculations students can use to increase their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) in accordance with the Istanbul Gelisim University Associate and Undergraduate Education-Training and Examination Regulations.

---

## Overview: Known Processes
According to the regulations, any student wishing to increase their CGPA may retake previously completed and passed courses with the approval of their advisor. In this case, the student's latest grade (even if lower than the previous grade) is included in the CGPA calculation, and the previous grade is completely deleted.

## Little-Known and Critical Details

Below are the strategically important articles behind the bureaucratic language:

### 1. Status of "Extra" Courses Taken
Elective courses taken outside the curriculum or in excess are not included in the CGPA calculation. Only the courses in the credits and numbers required by the teaching program are included in the CGPA, starting from the course with the highest grade. Excess courses failed at the graduation stage are deleted from the transcript.

### 2. Pre-Graduation Rights
If you have passed all courses but cannot graduate because your CGPA is below the 2.00 threshold, you can use the right to take exams without re-registering for courses:
* Associate Degree: The right to take exams from courses excluding the first two semesters.
* Undergraduate: The right to take exams from courses excluding the first four semesters and those without attendance requirements.
* Important: The last grade received by the student taking this exam is valid. If you receive an FF in this exam, you must re-register for that course by paying the course fee in the following semester.

### 3. Grade Change in Summer School
The grade received in summer school overrides the previously received grade for that course in the general average calculation; only the grade received in summer school is used in the CGPA calculation.

### 4. Grade Improvement via Makeup Exams
Makeup exams are a right not only for failed courses but also for conditionally passed (DD/DC) courses. For students who have the right to take the makeup exam but do not attend, the final grade remains as is.

## Nexus CGPA Projection Formula

When making a decision to improve a grade, you can calculate the effect of the course to be repeated on the CGPA with the following mathematical model. This formula shows the ratio of the difference between the target new letter grade coefficient and the old grade to the total credit load.

$$\Delta CGPA = \frac{(K_{target} - K_{current}) \cdot Cr_{course}}{\sum Cr_{total}}$$

### Variable Descriptions:
* $\Delta CGPA$: Net increase in the cumulative average after grade improvement.
* $K_{target}$: Coefficient of the new grade you are targeting (e.g., 4.00 for AA).
* $K_{current}$: Coefficient of the current grade (e.g., 1.50 for DD).
* $Cr_{course}$: Local credit of the course to be repeated.
* $\sum Cr_{total}$: Total local credits of all courses completed up to that point.

> Example Strategy: Raising a high-credit course from DD to AA may be more efficient than raising 3 low-credit courses.
